I worked with the client to design and implement treasurezine.com, a "monthly showcase of original essays written by funny and talented people from across the world".
The primary focus of the design was to create a clean, minimalist, uninterrupted reading experience showcasing the long form content of the site.

The site was implemented on a wordpress backend to maximise ease of use for the website's administrator.
